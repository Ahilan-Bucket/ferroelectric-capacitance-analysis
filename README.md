# ferroelectric-capacitance-analysis
Working on LabVIEW program to control the temperature and measure the capacitance, by doing a curve fit to data acquired from the triggered signal acquisition of the decay of a series RC circuit. Sweep the temperature from just above room temperature to 100 â—¦C, recording the time, temperature, and capacitance. Automatically
